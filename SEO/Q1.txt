Q5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.
A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon associated with a website or webpage. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, next to the page's title, and in browser tabs. Favicons provide a visual representation of a website, making it easier for users to identify and differentiate between multiple open tabs. The standard format for favicons is the (Icon) file format, although other image formats like PNG and GIF are also commonly used.
Example :-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
