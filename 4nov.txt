Question 1:Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
Ans:-JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used in web development. Its
fundamental role is to enhance web pages by adding interactivity and dynamic behavior. JavaScript runs
directly in web browsers, allowing developers to create features such as form validation, animations, and real-
time updates.

JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the webpage's structure. This
interaction enables developers to manipulate and modify webpage content, styles, and layout in response to
user actions. JavaScript also handles events, making it possible to create interactive web applications.
Furthermore, JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, crucial for tasks like sending and receiving
data from web servers without blocking the user interface. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks,
such as React and Angular, that simplify and accelerate web development.

Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.
Ans:-
JavaSCript
1.JavaScript is a high-level programming language used for adding interactivit and functionality to web pages.
2. JavaScript allows you to create dynamic elements and behaviors on a webpage. For
example, you can validate form inputs, create animations, or update content in real-time based on user
actions.
3. JavaScript includes variables, data types, and control structures like loops and
conditionals, enabling you to create complex logic and algorithms.
4. JavaScript runs in web browsers, making it a client-side technology. It executes on the user's
device, enabling real-time user interactions.
HTML
1. HTML is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on web pages.
2. HTML defines the static structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
and images.
3. HTML uses tags (e.g., <div>, <p>, <a>) to create elements that structure the content and
provide semantic meaning.
4. HTML's primary role is to define the content's structure and semantics, which browsers
render as a web page.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of both JavaScript and HTML in a typical web development
scenario:
Code:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Interactive Web Page</title>
<script>
// JavaScript function to change the color of a text when clicked
function changeColor() {
var textElement = document.getElementById("myText");
textElement.style.color = "blue";
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to My Interactive Web Page</h1>
<p>This is a sample webpage with a <span id="myText"
onclick="changeColor()">clickable text</span>.</p>
</body>
</html>
HTML:-
HTML is used to structure the webpage, define headings (<h1>) and paragraphs (<p>), and create a clickable
text element with the ID "myText."
JAVASCRIPT:-
JavaScript is used to define a function (changeColor) that changes the color of the text with the ID "myText" to
blue when it's clicked. This demonstrates how JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the
webpage by responding to user actions.
This single example showcases the role of both JavaScript and HTML in web development, with HTML
structuring the content and JavaScript providing interactivity.

Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

JavaScript has five primitive data types, which are the simplest and most fundamental data types.
1. The number data type represents numeric values. It can include integers, floating-point numbers,
and special values like NaN (Not-a-Number) and Infinity. For example:
Solution:
Number:
let integerNumber = 42;
let floatingPointNumber = 3.14;
let notANumber = NaN;
let positiveInfinity = Infinity;

2. String
The string data type represents sequences of characters enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (` `)
quotes. Strings are used to represent text data. For example:
let name = "John";0
let message = 'Hello, World!';
let templateLiteral = `My name is ${name}`;

3. Boolean
The boolean data type has only two values, true and false, and is used to represent logical values. Booleans are
commonly used for conditions and comparisons. For example:
let isUserLoggedIn = true;
let isDataValid = false;

4. Null
The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value or a value that has been explicitly set
to indicate no value. It is often used to initialize variables before assigning meaningful values. For example:
let address = null;

5. Undefined
The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is
often the initial value of variables. For example:
let firstName; // firstName is undefined

Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

ANS:- Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript:
The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve a memory location for storing data values that
can be used throughout a program. Variables act as placeholders for data, making it easier to work with and
manipulate information in your code. Declaring variables allows you to:
1. Variables can store various types of data, such as numbers, text, and objects.
2. You can perform operations on the data stored in variables, such as calculations,
concatenations, and comparisons.
3. Variables enable you to reuse values at different points in your code, reducing redundancy.
4. Variables can be used to control the flow of your program through conditions and loops.
Declaring Variables using the 'let' Keyword:
In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the 'let' keyword. Here's the basic syntax for declaring a variable
let variableName;
 let: This keyword indicates that you are declaring a variableF
 variableName: Replace this with the name you want to give to your variable. It should follow JavaScript's

variable naming rules, such as starting with a letter, using letters, numbers, or underscores, and being case-
sensitive.

Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

ANS:-Comments in JavaScript are essential for code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among
developers. They serve several important purposes:
1. Comments provide explanations and context about the code's purpose, logic, and
functionality. This makes it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand and work with the
code.
2. Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" code during debugging,
helping you isolate issues without deleting code.
3. Comments allow developers to communicate with each other, explaining why certain
decisions were made or describing how specific code segments work.
4. Comments can be used to divide code into logical sections, making it easier to navigate and
maintain larger codebases.
5. In some cases, comments may be required to explain licensing, copyright
information, or compliance with regulations.

Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and
maintainability. Here are several reasons why it's important:
1. Descriptive variable names make your code easier to read and understand. Developers
(including yourself) can quickly grasp the purpose of a variable without needing to analyze the code in detail.
2. Well-named variables reduce the chances of introducing bugs when modifying or
extending code. You're less likely to misunderstand the variable's role and make incorrect changes.
3. Descriptive variable names serve as a form of self-documentation. They convey the intent
and context of the variable, reducing the need for additional comments.
4. When working in teams, clear variable names facilitate communication among developers.
Team members can understand each other's code more easily, leading to more efficient collaboration.
5. Meaningful variable names help prevent errors caused by using the wrong variable or
making incorrect assumptions about variable values.
